# Project 3 - Interactive Form

In this project, we will use the technique known as "pagination" to enhance the usability of a web page.  We will start with a page that contains a list of 54 student names, photos and email addresses. We will display 10 names at a time, and add a navigation system -- a series of links at the bottom of the page -- to let users click through the other student entries, 10 at a time.
