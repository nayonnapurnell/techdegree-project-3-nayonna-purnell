Interactive Form

# Project 3 - Interactive Form

In this project, we will use JavaScript to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional conference called "FullStack Conf."

Using the supplied HTML and CSS files, we will add your own JavaScript to make the form more user-friendly by:

adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity
validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.
After completing this project, we will have a solid foundational knowledge of using and customizing forms in your projects. This is tremendously valuable since forms are a major aspect of most web sites and web applications, which makes this project a key addition to your portfolio, and a crucial step on your journey to becoming a professional full stack web developer.
